# Employee_tracker

## Description

This project is an employee tracker, it allows management to view, add and update, employees, departments and roles in an organisation easily. This allows organisations to keep track of there human resources and assets. This project used express, inquirer, node.js in addition to mysql. Mysql was used to create the databases of the employees, roles and departments, I connected it to the server.js file so users could add the database through the console, allowing for a clean and easy user experience.
